# Summary

Over the decades, significant trends and patterns have emerged from the data, painting a detailed picture of global population dynamics and the impact of financial assistance from institutions like IBRD and IDA.

Initially, in the 1960s, the world saw modest population increases, with the percentage growth rate hovering around 2% annually. This growth was more evenly distributed among various income groups, leading to less pronounced disparities in wealth. However, as time progressed, these dynamics shifted considerably.

The combined efforts of IBRD and IDA have been monumental in supporting global populations. IBRD alone has provided financial assistance to 24 billion people, while IDA has reached 6 billion. Together, their impact has been far-reaching, helping to uplift large segments of the global population.

Despite the overall increase in population, the percentage increase compared to previous years has been declining, especially in recent years. By the 2020s, the growth rate had fallen to under 1.2%, indicating a slowing pace of population expansion.

The developing countries, often referred to as the Late-Demographic Dividend, have shown remarkable growth. These countries are experiencing significant demographic changes and rapid population increases. In contrast, heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) continue to struggle, reflecting the ongoing challenges they face.

The Arab world has undergone tremendous population growth, surpassing even the European Union in numbers. Meanwhile, European nations have seen relatively stagnant population growth. OECD members, however, have significantly contributed to global population growth, reflecting their economic stability and development.

As the middle-income group has grown substantially over the years, wealth disparities have become more pronounced. Initially, there was not much difference among various income groups, but the development of the middle-income group has led to greater economic inequality.

Asian countries now dominate the world in terms of population, with East Asia & Pacific and South Asia leading the charge. Sub-Saharan Africa also shows substantial demographic growth. Conversely, regions such as the Central African Republic, Caribbean small states, Pacific island small states, and St. Martin have experienced minimal to no population growth.

In summary, the world population has grown from 3 billion in 1960 to 8 billion in 2022. This growth has been accompanied by significant demographic shifts and economic changes, influenced by global financial assistance and the varying development trajectories of different regions.
